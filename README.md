# Group10 Livability Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a data-driven dashboard evaluating the livability of U.S. states using key indicators such as happiness, taxation, climate, and environmental factors.

## 📊 Insights from the Dashboard

### 🧘 Happiness and Well-being
States like **California**, **Massachusetts**, and **Hawaii** score highest in total happiness. These scores reflect strong emotional and physical well-being, vibrant communities, and favorable work environments.

### 💵 Tax Considerations
- **Alaska** and **Florida** offer low or zero state tax rates, making them financially attractive—particularly for individuals aiming to maximize disposable income.
- **California** and **New York** impose higher combined tax rates, which may be offset by broader services and amenities.

### ☀️ Climate Preferences
- **Arizona** and **California** enjoy high average temperatures and substantial annual sunlight—ideal for those who favor warm, sunny climates.
- **Alaska** features lower temperatures and reduced sunlight exposure, catering to those who prefer cooler, more temperate environments.

### 🌪️ Extreme Weather and Environmental Conditions
- Southern states such as **Alabama** and **Arkansas** report a higher number of extreme weather events, a consideration for risk-averse residents.
- Northern and coastal states often face fewer weather-related disruptions.

### ⚖️ Trade-Offs in State Selection
No single state ranks best across all categories:
- **California** excels in well-being and sunshine but has high taxes.
- **Alaska** offers tax advantages but colder, darker climates.
- **Arizona** balances moderate taxes and high sunlight with mid-range happiness scores.

These trade-offs highlight the need for personalized decision-making based on one's values and lifestyle goals.
